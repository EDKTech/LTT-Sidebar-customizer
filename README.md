# Linus Tech Tips forum customizer

A basic browser addon to customize the www.linustechtips.com forum.

I am in no way affilliated with Linus Media Group or the Linus Tech Tips forum.

## Updated to v0.9.1 on 24th May, 2022
Changelogs:
- Option to show Status Updates section on all pages. This is done by making a request to the main page and pulling the Status Updates section and concatenating it to the sidebar.
- Redesign of the configurator.
- [Minor] Option to manually set the margin on badges to 3px. This was previously done by default.
- New [documentation](https://github.com/RockSolid1106/LTT-Sidebar-customizer/blob/Chromium/documentation.md) for all features of the customizer.

4. You're done! Check the LTT forum to check if the extension works!

## Alternative
If you have the extension pinned to the browser's address bar, you can click that and access the customization menu with ease.

## Privacy
This extension does not collect any information from the end user. While I'd love to say this is so because I care for and respect your privacy, this is just because I can't be bothered to implement that. Though, rest assured, I will never take the efforts to implement any sort of tracking in the extension.

# Errors and Issues
Please raise an issue if the extension doesn't work properly. There might be some pages which I'm not aware of where the extension doesn't work. Please attach a screenshot of the console(Ctrl + Shift + J).

# Feedback
DM me on the LTT forum. It's RockSolid1106 on the forum. What are you doing here if you don't know my username? /s
