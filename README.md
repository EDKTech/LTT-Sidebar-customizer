# Linus Tech Tips forum customizer

A basic Chrome extension to customize the www.linustechtips.com forum.

I am in no way affilliated with Linus Media Group or the Linus Tech Tips forum.

## Updated to v0.9.1 on 24th May, 2022
Changelogs:
- Option to show Status Updates section on all pages. This is done by making a request to the main page and pulling the Status Updates section and concatenating it to the sidebar.
- Redesign of the configurator.
- [Minor] Option to manually set the margin on badges to 3px. This was previously done by default.
- New [documentation](https://github.com/RockSolid1106/LTT-Sidebar-customizer/blob/Chromium/documentation.md) for all features of the customizer.
